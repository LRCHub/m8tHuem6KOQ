Fillin' all the skies of night it soon creates a
flower
City voices are all wrapped in by the shining
light and sounds remove
World of all silence, all that was left is two
alone, then echoing out, the words are
"I'm in love with you"
You met up with me inside a dream, our future
was shown
Night of summer, you and me form silhouettes,
mine right there next to you
Final of all fireworks to rise into the sky,
when it fades away
That'll be the sign for this
It's you, an ordinary morning
It's an ordinary lookin' image you got on
All reason for me breakin' every eye contact
with you was, ah
For I have been consumed by words let out in
what you've shown, even now
still it resumes to keep ringin' on inside
Ah, onto where night will end, awaiting past
dreamin'
To want it to arrive and find it
Foretold in a dream, and waiting until now, but
is it true?
Worries deep in my head seem loud but I'll keep
on
Ah, and out through our present, and soon know
what begins
You and me will be on our own and
More, almost
Don't alter what I am waiting for
Almost
so please go on to talk about it
I'll be waiting right there to hear you
No one knows of this night
Nobody's here but me and you
The scenery I've waited for now overlapping with
our view
The present and beyond, upon the summer sky
attachin' all within the firework I see
We're in the focal place where I had known to
trace my dream with you
We're looking up into the skies above lit up and
shining bright
shed light upon your profile and ah
So, as told, led us to the scene known and made
it
So, it's two of our futures, to go here right
now
And overlapping real soon
Ah, you're in our night with me, just me and
you, that's it
Foretold and now we've come, arrivin'
Fine, go through, your mind will be told Fine,
go through, be understood
And the scenes beyond what's dreamt to be
reachin'
Ah, and out through our present, and soon know
what begins
And our days are entact for we've met
More, almost
Don't alter what I am waiting for
Almost
Look up, final of the fireworks is now
here wrapping over two
World of no sound in the silence, you speak
"I'm in love with you"
